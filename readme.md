  ## Database

  -- PostgresSQL used as a database
  -- Schemas defined using Sequelize
  -- Several relationships (One to One, Many to One and Many to Many) have been defined between the main schemas (including user,blog ,comment and category schemas) in order to increase efficiency in data retrieval and eliminate redundancies. DAO as well as lazy and eager loading methods have been utilized.
